The Meal App

This project is a web application that leverages the power of vanilla JavaScript to provide a seamless user experience. The app's main feature is its ability to search for food recipes using the Themealdb API. The API returns a wealth of data related to the searched recipe, including ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information. The app then presents this information in a user-friendly format, enabling users to quickly find the recipes they are looking for.
Key Features

Search Meals by Name: Easily search for recipes by name, making it convenient to find specific dishes.
Auto Suggestion: The app provides auto-suggestions based on the keywords entered, helping users discover new recipes.
Save Favorite Meals: Users can mark their favorite recipes for easy access in the future, ensuring they never lose their go-to meals.

Persistent Storage: The app stores saved meals, allowing users to restore them even after reopening the browser.
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices, ensuring a consistent experience across platforms.
